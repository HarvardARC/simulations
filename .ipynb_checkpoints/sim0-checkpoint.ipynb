      "\n",
      "First, welcome to [ARC](http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/harvard-arc/). The first comment that needs to be said is that yes, we are computer scientists. Whether you are doing research in a lab, in the field, or in Wall Street, being a scientist means being a computer scientist. Which means now more than ever, computer science is becoming wanted if not necessary. So while ARC is a club that focuses on finance, what we are really doing is Computer Science. \n",

Knowledge of Python is not a prerequisite for participation in ARC; only a basic level of programming experience is needed. The programming component of this course is straightforward, so all you will need to pick up on your own is Python syntax. Basically, you should feel comfortable with:\n",
